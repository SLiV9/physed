First, we write the numbers 2 to 20 in their prime factors:
2
3
2 2
5
2 3
7
2 2 2
3 3
2 5
11
2 2 3
13
2 7
3 5
2 2 2 2
17
2 3 3
19
2 2 5
Then we go down the list and scratch numbers that are already in the list.
2
3
. 2
5
. .
7
. . 2
. 3
. .
11
. . .
13
. .
. .
. . . 2
17
. . .
19
. . .

The answer is the product of the numbers currently on the list:
2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232792560
